Galette's unit tests
====================

/!\ This is a work in progress... Many classes are missing yet. /!\

Galette unit tests has been written on the top of atoum (http://atoum.org/).

If atoum executable is in your path, you can run ../bin/tests script.
Alternatively, you can download atoum and run it locally:
$ http://downloads.atoum.org/nightly/mageekguy.atoum.phar
$ php mageekguy.atoum.phar -bf TestsBootstrap.php -c coverage.php -d Galette

This will execute all tests; and generate relevant coverage report.
Please read atoum documentation at http://docs.atoum.org/ if you want
to learn more.

Note that tests respects Galette's path model under lib directory,
but in an additionnal tests/units/ directory. For example, Plugins
(\Galette\Core\Plugins) test class will be \Galette\Core\tests\units\Plugins.
